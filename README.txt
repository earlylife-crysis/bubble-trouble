Bubble Trouble

The features implemented are as follows

-> There are three levels, of increasing complexity
-> A level indicator has been implemented at the bottom of the game window
-> Level transitions last for 5 seconds
-> Gravity has been introduced (50 units); the bubbles move in a parabolic fashion, and bounce off the floor elastically
-> Bullets disappear when they hit a bubble
-> The bubbles, when hit by a bullet split into two parts of equal radii (half that of the original ball). However, the smallest possible bubble is of radius 10 units, after which the bubble disappears
-> The split bubbles move in opposite directions at 1.2x times the base speed of the bubble
-> The split bubbles retain the y-direction velocity of the mother bubble
-> A collision between a bubble and the shooter at any stage of the game results in a 'Game Over' message, and termination of the program after 5 seconds
-> Successful completion of the game results in a 'Congratulations' message, followed by the termination of the program after 5 seconds

I have attached a link to a video in which I demonstrate the implemented features below.
